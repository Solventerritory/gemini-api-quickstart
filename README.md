# Gemini API Quickstart - Python

This repository contains a simple Python Flask App running with the Google AI Gemini API, designed to get you started building with Gemini's multi-modal capabilities. The app comes with a basic UI and a Flask backend.

## Basic request

To send your first API request with the [Google Gen AI SDK](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/libraries#python), make sure you have the right dependencies installed (see installation steps below) and then run the following code:

```python
from google import genai

client = genai.Client(api_key="GEMINI_API_KEY")
chat = client.chats.create(model="gemini-2.0-flash")

response = chat.send_message("Hello world!")
print(response.text)

response = chat.send_message("Explain to me how AI works")
print(response.text)

for message in chat.get_history():
    print(f'role - {message.role}',end=": ")
    print(message.parts[0].text)
```

## Setup

1. If you don’t have Python installed, install it [from Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository.

3. Create a new virtual environment:

   - macOS:
     ```bash
     $ python -m venv venv
     $ . venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - Windows:
     ```cmd
     > python -m venv venv
     > .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - Linux:
      ```bash
      $ python -m venv venv
      $ source venv/bin/activate
      ```

4. Install the requirements:

   ```bash
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Make a copy of the example environment variables file:

   ```bash
   $ cp .env.example .env
   ```

6. Add your [API key](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key) to the newly created `.env` file or as an environment variable.

7. Run the app:

```bash
$ flask run
```

You should now be able to access the app from your browser at the following URL: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)!

## Troubleshooting: DefaultCredentialsError / missing credentials

If you see an error like:

```
google.auth.exceptions.DefaultCredentialsError: Your default credentials were not found.
```

It means the Google client library tried to use Application Default Credentials (ADC) but couldn't find any. You have three common options to fix this:

1) Use an API key (recommended for this quickstart)

- Add your Gemini API key to the repository `.env` file as `GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key` or export it in your shell:

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
flask run
```

2) Use Application Default Credentials (for user credentials)

- Install and authenticate with the Google Cloud SDK and run:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

3) Use a service account JSON key (server-to-server)

 - Create a service account in your Google Cloud project, download the JSON key file, and set the path:

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/service-account.json"
flask run
```

If you prefer the app to fail loudly with a helpful message instead of crashing at import, the server now prints a short guidance message at startup and surfaces it in the UI when credentials are missing.
